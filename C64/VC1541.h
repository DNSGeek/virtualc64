    /*! Background: The VC1541 drive is clocked by 16 Mhz. The base frequency is divided by N where N ranges
        from 13 (zone 0) to 16 (zone 4). On the logic board, this is done with a 4-bit counter of type 74SL193 
        whose reset value bits are connected to the two "zone" bits (PB5 and PB6) coming from via 2.
        A second 74SL193 divides the signal by 4. The result serves as the clock signal for all units operating 
        on bit level (i.e., the two shift registers that transfer bits from and to the head).
        It follows that a single bit is ready after 3,25 CPU cycles in zone 0 and 4 CPU cycles in zone 4.
        The resulting signal is fed into a third counter (of type 74LS191). It divides the signal by 8 and its 
        output is fed into a three input NAND-gate computing the important BYTE-READY signal. */
